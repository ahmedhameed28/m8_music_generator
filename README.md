# Triumph Music
A music generator using Sonic Pi for my Computational Creativity course (CSCI 3725). The goal of this project was to create a piece of music using code that was either educational or relaxing. I opted for the relaxing music and I wanted to create something that conveyed triumph but unfortunately what I ended up with was just not that. I'm not sure what happened but my generated is now very erie and spooky.

I utilized various functions in the program which tried to rearrange the notes and that's who I got my output.
